Really gonna try to practice good workflow on this one, pushing in little increments instead of doing huge swathes of work and several rewrites between commits as has been my bad habit up until now.

Btw I love grid, it makes so much more sense to me than flexbox!
I'm sure I'll find use cases for flex but right now I'm in love with this.
