How it started:

"Really gonna try to practice good workflow on this one, pushing in little increments instead of doing huge swathes of work and several rewrites between commits as has been my bad habit up until now.

Btw I love grid, it makes so much more sense to me than flexbox!
I'm sure I'll find use cases for flex but right now I'm in love with this."

How it went:

I did in fact have a WAY better git workflow then I've had before, really proud of that.

Sure learned a LOT on this one! The biggest lesson is probably; always make sure the big picture is solid before going deeper. Maybe not always possible but trying to be more strict with that would have saved me a lot of headaches here.

It looks okay all things considered! Kinda proud of this janky POS.

Got a lot more comfortable with grid in the process, but there were times in the beginning (the header) where I fell back on flexbox because I was a bit lazy and didn't get how to make it work in grid. 

Kinda burnt out on this project now, it feels 'good enough' for practice and I'm really itching to move on to databases. Onwards and upwards!
